    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Magictime Apps ,(“Magictime Apps ,” “us,” "we," or “our”) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy in connection with your use of our website, www.MagictimeApps.com (the “Website(s)”), applications (“Apps”) and other products, services and features thereof (the Website, the Apps and such other products, services and features are collectively referred to herein as the “Product” or “Products”, which may be updated from time-to-time at the sole discretion of Magictime Apps ). This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) and any other documents referred to herein set forth the basis on which any personal information we collect from you, or that you provide to us, in connection with the Products will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal information and how we will collect, use and disclose your personal information.</p>

    <h2>1. INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU</h2>

    <br />
    
    <p>Personal information including, for example, your name, e-mail address, telephone, information about your usage of the Products and information collected by tracking technologies as further described below that may identify you as an individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an individual.</p>
    <p>For individuals who participate in a Magictime Apps  Family plan, we may collect additional personal information, for example, home address in order to verify family member status.</p>
    <p>If, as a primary account holder of a Magictime Apps  Family plan, you choose to invite additional family members to become subsidiary account holders, we will ask you for their name and email address. We will use this information to invite him or her to join the Products. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending invitations and confirming family member status. If your subsidiary account holder(s) would like us to delete their information, they can do so by contacting the primary account holder of their family plan to be removed.</p>
    <p>Magictime Apps  does not collect or process credit or debit card (“Payment Card”) information. Apple and Google collect Payment Card information with respect to in-app purchases made through the Apps, and our payment processor collects Payment Card information with respect to purchases made through the Websites. Such payment processors generally provide us with some limited information related to you, such as a unique token that enables you to make additional purchases using the information they’ve - stored, and your card’s type, expiration date, billing address, and the last four digits of your card number.</p>
    <p>For individuals using the Products in connection with a Community client account as described in section 6, business information such as your company name, and company email address to the extent that you provide such information</p>

    <p>If you choose to invite a “Buddy” to use the Products using our Buddy system, we will ask you for their name and email address. We will use this information to invite him or her to join the Products. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending invitations and tracking the success of our Buddy program. If your Buddy would like us to delete his or her information, they can do so by opting-out as described in each invitation or by contacting us at info@magictimeapps.com.</p>
    <p>If you choose to have your account verified to confirm your status as a student, we may allow a third party platform to access the specific personal information you provide in order to perform the verification.</p>

    <h2>2. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</h2>

    <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at info@magictimeapps.com. Except as described under the “Disclosure of Your Information” section below, we do not provide your personal information to any third party without your specific consent, as defined by applicable law.</p>

    <h2>3. NEWSLETTERS OR OTHER ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS</h2>

    <p>If you sign up to receive promotional materials from us via email we will use the information you give us to provide the communications you have requested.</p>

If you no longer wish to receive push notifications, you may turn them off at the device level.</p>

    <p>If you provide your phone number to us directly or through a third-party for the specific purpose of receiving an SMS message with a link to our Apps, you will receive such SMS message (the “SMS Service”). Standard text message rates will apply.</p>

    <h2>4. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h2>

    <p>Magictime Apps  and our analytics partners use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts to enable a service to recognize your device so you don't have to provide the same information several times during one task, recognize that you may have already given a password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested, and to measure how people are using the Products.</p>

    <p>We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Products also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.</p>

    <p>We partner with third parties, such as Facebook and Google, to manage our advertising of the Products on other sites or platforms as well as across your other devices based on your past visits to our website. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities within the Products to deliver such advertising to you, such as retargeting ads. We will acquire consent from you in order to use such trackers for advertising purposes to the extent required by applicable law. We currently do not respond to do-not-track signals. For more information about interest-based ads, including how to opt-out of having your web-browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices. Please note that this does not opt you out of being served ads. You may continue to receive generic ads on these third party platforms. You may also opt out of receiving ads across devices by adjusting your ad preference in your Google account.</p>

    <p>We use third party trackers to let us know when users have visited the Products by “clicking-through” our sponsored advertising or content hosted on third party platforms. The Products use Google Analytics code to gather statistical information. Google Analytics sets cookies to help us accurately estimate the number of visitors to the Products and the volumes of usage of the Products. This is done to ensure that the Products are available when you want them and are fast. For more information on how Google Analytics processes this information, visit www.google.com/analytics.</p>

    <h3>MOBILE ANALYTICS</h3>
    <p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you engage with the Products, the events that occur within the Products, aggregated usage and performance data, and where the Applications were downloaded from. We may link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.</p>

    <h3>LOG FILES</h3>
    <p>As true of most websites, we gather certain information and automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.</p>
    <p>If you receive the HTML-formatted version of our email newsletter, your opening of the newsletter is notified to us and saved. Your clicks on links in the newsletter are also saved. These and the open statistics are used in aggregate form to give us an indication of the popularity of the content and to help us make decisions about future content and formatting.</p>

    <h2>5. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>All information you provide to us through the Products is stored on our secure servers located in the US. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology; all payment information is stored with our payment processor and is never stored on Magictime Apps ’s servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Products, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone, and suggest that your change your password frequently.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to the Products; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

    <h2>6. CORPORATE AND OTHER COMMUNITY SHARING</h2>

    <p>There is interest by large consumer communities (companies, universities, hospitals, etc.) (“Communities”) to introduce the Products to their employees and members. If you have registered to use the Products through a code or other registration credential furnished by a Community (a “Community Subscription”), the Community will have access to your email address,, and the date you registered to use the Products, and the date on which you last used the Products. The Community will also have access to general usage information on an anonymized and aggregated basis with all other members of the Community that are using the Products.</p>

    <p>Your Community may also have access to your usage information on an individual basis if you have provided appropriate consent under applicable law for such sharing. For example, many employers are offering incentive programs based on employee participation in health & wellness programs and desire to better understand how each of their individual employees is using the Products.</p>

    <h2>7. SINGLE SIGN-ON</h2>

    <p>You can log into our Products using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity, provide you the option to share certain personal information (such as your name and email address) with us, and to pre-populate our sign-up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you to the option to post information about your activities on our Products or to your profile page to share with others within your network.</p>
